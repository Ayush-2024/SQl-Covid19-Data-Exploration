# COVID-19 Data Exploration

## Project Overview

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing global COVID-19 data using SQL. The objective was to extract actionable insights related to infection rates, death tolls, vaccination coverage, and the relationship between these factors and population metrics. Advanced SQL techniques such as **Joins**, **CTEs**, **Temp Tables**, **Window Functions**, and **Aggregate Functions** were utilized to perform complex analyses and deliver insights that can inform policy decisions, public health strategies, and data-driven decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration & Analysis**: Performed exploratory data analysis on COVID-19 case and death data, focusing on geographic regions and temporal trends.
- **Infection and Death Rates Analysis**: Analyzed the likelihood of dying from COVID-19 by comparing death counts to total cases, as well as identifying regions with the highest infection rates.
- **Vaccination Coverage**: Merged COVID-19 vaccination data to assess the percentage of populations vaccinated, with a focus on regional and global vaccination progress.
- **Window Functions & Aggregates**: Leveraged advanced SQL functions like `SUM() OVER()`, `MAX()`, and `AVG()` for in-depth statistical analysis and to identify trends across various regions.
- **Reusable Views & CTEs**: Created reusable views and common table expressions (CTEs) for performing complex calculations like rolling vaccination coverage over time.
- **Global & Regional Insights**: Compared countries and continents in terms of their infection rates, death rates, and vaccination progress.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: Advanced querying techniques using SQL Server (or MySQL/PostgreSQL, depending on your database).
- **Window Functions**: `SUM() OVER()`, `PARTITION BY`, `ROW_NUMBER()` for calculating rolling totals and ranking.
- **CTEs**: For breaking down complex queries into more manageable and readable parts.
- **Temp Tables**: For performing intermediate calculations and storing results for further analysis.
- **Data Transformation**: Used data transformation techniques such as type conversions (`CONVERT()`) and percentage calculations.

## Key Insights & Analysis

- **Infection Rates**: Explored the relationship between total cases and population to determine which regions had the highest infection rates.
- **Death Rate Analysis**: Compared the death counts across countries and continents, identifying regions with disproportionately high death rates.
- **Vaccination Progress**: Merged vaccination data to track vaccination coverage and its impact on COVID-19 infection rates. Analyzed the percentage of the population vaccinated over time.
- **Global vs. Regional Trends**: Examined global trends and regional variations in case counts, death rates, and vaccination progress.

## Results

- **Improved Understanding of the Pandemic's Impact**: Gained valuable insights into how different regions experienced the pandemic, which can be used for better public health planning.
- **Actionable Insights for Health Organizations**: Provided insights on how vaccination rates relate to infection and death rates, helping to inform future public health strategies.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: The analyses can help policymakers make more informed decisions about vaccine distribution and resource allocation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the SQL script files to explore the queries and analysis steps.
3. Run the queries in your preferred SQL environment (SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
4. Modify and adapt the queries as needed to apply them to other datasets or regions.

## Future Improvements

- **Additional Data Sources**: Plan to integrate more data sources, such as economic impact data, to provide a more comprehensive view of the pandemicâ€™s effect on society.
- **Data Visualization**: Future iterations of this project will involve integrating these analyses into data visualization tools like Power BI or Tableau to provide more interactive, user-friendly reports.
- **Advanced Predictive Modeling**: Implement machine learning techniques to predict future trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths based on historical data.
