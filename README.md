# COVID-19 Data Exploration

## Project Overview

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing global COVID-19 data using **SQL** and **Python**. The goal is to extract actionable insights related to infection rates, death tolls, vaccination coverage, and the relationships between these factors and population metrics. Advanced SQL techniques, such as **Joins**, **CTEs**, **Temp Tables**, **Window Functions**, and **Aggregate Functions**, were used to perform complex analyses, while **Python** was leveraged for additional data processing, automation, and visualization tasks.

The project combines the power of SQL for structured querying and Python for advanced data analysis and visualization to deliver insights that can inform policy decisions, public health strategies, and data-driven decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration & Analysis**: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 case and death data using SQL, focusing on geographic regions and temporal trends.
- **Infection and Death Rates Analysis**: Analyzed the likelihood of dying from COVID-19 by comparing death counts to total cases, as well as identifying regions with the highest infection rates using SQL.
- **Vaccination Coverage**: Merged COVID-19 vaccination data to assess the percentage of populations vaccinated and analyzed vaccination progress globally and regionally.
- **Window Functions & Aggregates**: Utilized advanced SQL functions like `SUM() OVER()`, `MAX()`, and `AVG()` to generate rolling totals and identify trends across regions.
- **Reusable Views & CTEs**: Created reusable views and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to handle complex calculations, like rolling vaccination coverage over time.
- **Global & Regional Insights**: Compared infection rates, death rates, and vaccination progress between countries and continents.
- **Data Automation & Visualization with Python**: Used Python for automating the extraction, cleaning, and processing of COVID-19 data. Visualized trends using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for better decision-making insights.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: Advanced querying techniques (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server) to extract and manipulate data.
- **Python**: 
  - **Pandas** for data processing and cleaning.
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.
  - **NumPy** for numerical computations and statistical analysis.
  - **Jupyter Notebooks** for combining code, visualizations, and explanatory notes.
- **Window Functions**: SQL window functions (`SUM() OVER()`, `PARTITION BY`, `ROW_NUMBER()`) for calculating rolling totals and ranking regions based on performance.
- **CTEs**: For creating readable and reusable subqueries.
- **Temp Tables**: Used for intermediate data storage and more efficient calculations.
- **Data Transformation**: Type conversions, percentage calculations, and data wrangling both in SQL and Python.

## Key Insights & Analysis

- **Infection Rates**: Analyzed the relationship between total cases and population, identifying regions with the highest infection rates. 
- **Death Rate Analysis**: Compared death counts across countries and continents, identifying regions with disproportionately high death rates.
- **Vaccination Progress**: Merged vaccination data to track vaccination coverage over time and analyze its impact on COVID-19 infection rates.
- **Global vs. Regional Trends**: Examined global trends and regional variations in case counts, death rates, and vaccination progress, identifying hotspots and trends.
- **Automation & Visual Insights**: Leveraged Python to automate repetitive tasks and visualize key findings like infection rates, vaccination coverage, and death percentages by country.

## Results

- **Improved Understanding of the Pandemic's Impact**: Gained valuable insights into how different regions were affected by the pandemic, with a focus on infection rates, death rates, and vaccination progress.
- **Actionable Insights for Public Health**: Provided actionable insights on how vaccination rates correlate with lower infection and death rates, helping to inform vaccine distribution strategies and public health policy.
- **Data-Driven Decision-Making**: Enabled data-driven decisions for policymakers, highlighting regions with the highest COVID-19 risk and helping to optimize vaccine distribution and resource allocation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **SQL**:
   - Open the SQL script files to explore the queries and analyses performed.
   - Run the SQL queries in your preferred SQL environment (SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   - Modify queries as needed for your own analysis or dataset.
3. **Python**:
   - Install required Python libraries: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy jupyter`.
   - Open the **Jupyter Notebooks** to explore the Python code, data visualizations, and analysis.
   - Modify the Python code to perform additional analyses or visualize different aspects of the COVID-19 data.

## Future Improvements

- **Additional Data Sources**: Plan to integrate more data sources, such as economic and social impact data, to provide a more comprehensive view of the pandemic's effect on society.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use Pythonâ€™s machine learning libraries (e.g., **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**) to develop predictive models for future COVID-19 trends.
- **Data Visualization Dashboard**: Integrate SQL queries with Python-based dashboards (e.g., using **Plotly Dash** or **Streamlit**) for real-time data visualization and reporting.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Implement time series forecasting models to predict future COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination coverage trends.

## Sample Queries

Here are some of the key SQL queries used in the analysis:

### 1. Infection Rate Analysis by Region

```sql
SELECT Location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1, 2;
